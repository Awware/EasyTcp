  <a>A high performance tcp server and client. (Async) (IPv6 & IPv4)<br/>Simple and easy to use.<a/>
  <br/><br/>
</p>

# Performance
Because EasyTcp is socket based and async it has good performance.
I made a test to see the performance.
This test will send a message to the server, then the server send the same message back.
If the client received the message it sends the next one.
The average of this test: 0.0582828ms (on localhost)
